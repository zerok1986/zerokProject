JS and other coding learning projects

This is intended to be a personal repository of interesting exercises, examples and great pieces of coding seen through my
coding/programming self-learning project.

I'm trying to learn from groundZero some basics about JS, first, and then about another programming languages (probably C, Java,
Python)

Wish me luck!! ;)
